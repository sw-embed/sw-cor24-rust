# Feedback Checklist

Tracks feedback from Luther Johnson and how each item was addressed.
Sources: email feedback (docs/*.txt), meeting notes (docs/cor24-meet-notes-20260317.txt).

## Architecture Corrections (feedback1.txt, cor24-feedback.txt)

- [x] Address space is 24 bits (16 MB), not 64 KB — fixed in docs and code
- [x] Only r0, r1, r2 are true GP registers (not 8) — fixed in ISA Ref, Tutorial
- [x] Z register is zero-only for compare instructions — fixed in ISA Ref, Tutorial
- [x] Instructions are 1, 2, or 4 bytes (never 3) — fixed in ISA Ref, Tutorial
- [x] PC-relative branch: PC is 2 ahead at execute time — implemented in executor

## Branding (research/feedback1.txt, research/feedback2a.txt)

- [x] Refer to CPU as "MakerLisp COR24" (mention once) — in header and README
- [x] Use "COR24" for subsequent references — throughout UI and docs
- [ ] Luther review for compatibility — pending his review

## Hardware Corrections (research/feedback2b.txt)

- [x] FPGA is MachXO (not MachXO2) — corrected in docs
- [x] 211 instruction forms (32 operations x register fields) — in ISA Ref
- [x] C = condition flag (not carry) — fixed everywhere
- [x] Only R0-R2 are GP; R3-R7 are special purpose — in ISA Ref, Tutorial
- [x] R5 is always-zero, accessed as "z" in compares only — in ISA Ref
- [x] 1 MB on-board SRAM — in memory map
- [x] Stack: FEE000-FEFFFF (8 KB range, 3 KB populated), SP init FEEC00 — in ISA Ref
- [x] Reading UART data register auto-acknowledges RX — in emulator (read_byte_exec)
- [x] D2 = user LED (active-low pull-up), S2 = button (active-low pull-up) — in emulator
- [ ] Two separate adders (add24ci, add24cico) — not modeled (functional emulation only)
- [ ] Test-bench simulates entire SOC — out of scope for web emulator

## Calling Convention (research/20260314-cor24-feedback.txt, research/20260303-luther-notes.txt)

- [x] Use jal instruction for calls (not manual la/push/jmp) — all examples updated
- [x] jal stores return address in r1 — documented in ISA Ref, Tutorial
- [x] Save/restore convention: push fp, r2, r1 / mov fp,sp — in Tutorial, Help
- [x] Arguments on stack, return value in r0 — documented
- [x] Leaf routines can skip unused saves — noted in Tutorial
- [x] Interrupts detected on bra/brf/brt/jmp/jal — implemented in executor

## NOP Instruction (cor24-nop-email.txt)

- [x] NOP is opcode 0xFF (actually "zxt z,z") — assembler emits 0xFF
- [x] "add r0,r0" is NOT a no-op (doubles r0) — fixed, was the old encoding
- [x] Executor handles 0xFF as true no-op — implemented

## Assembler Syntax (cor24-nop-email.txt)

- [x] Support Intel hex notation (0FFh not 0xFF) — parse_number supports both
- [x] sxt and zxt are supported — in assembler
- [x] sub sp,dddddd is supported — in assembler
- [x] la is supported by reference assembler — confirmed, examples use it
- [x] Labels must be on own line (reference compat) — all examples fixed

## UART TX Optimization (cor24-fib-email.txt)

- [x] Use cls r2,z / brt for TX busy check — fibonacci.s, multiply.s, uart_hello.s
- [x] Bit 7 on status byte = sign bit after lb — leveraged in UART examples
- [x] Applied to C pipeline examples — fib.cor24.s, sieve.cor24.s

## Assembly Idiom Improvements

### `add r0,-1` instead of `lc r2,1; sub r0,r2` (meeting notes)

Luther noted: use `add r2,-1` instead of loading a constant and subtracting.
This saves one instruction and avoids clobbering another register.

- [x] **countdown.s**: `lc r2,1; sub r0,r2` → `add r0,-1`
- [x] **fibonacci.s**: `push r0; lc r0,1; sub r2,r0; pop r0` → `add r2,-1` (saves 3 instructions)
- [x] **multiply.s**: `push r0; lc r0,1; sub r1,r0; pop r0` → `add r1,-1` (saves 3 instructions)

### Pre-decrement counter pattern (meeting notes)

Luther noted: "change counter-- to --counter" and "counter-- easier compare".
Pre-decrementing then testing is more idiomatic:
```
; Current (post-decrement style):
    lc  r0,1
    sub r2,r0       ; counter--
    ceq r2,z        ; == 0?
    brf loop

; Better (pre-decrement with add):
    add r2,-1       ; --counter
    ceq r2,z
    brf loop
```

- [x] Applied to fibonacci.s, countdown.s, multiply.s counter loops

### Echo example TX busy check (meeting notes)

Luther noted: "assembler example Echo also needs to check for TX busy"

- [x] **echo.s**: added cls/brt TX busy poll before all three UART writes
  (prompt, uppercase echo, as-is echo)

### C fib example line 11 (meeting notes)

Luther noted: "look at online, C, fib: line 11" — this is:
```
    la      r0, _main
    jal     r1, (r0)
```
- [ ] Review what Luther's concern was (possibly about using r0 vs r2 for call target)

### Button/LED inversion (meeting notes)

Luther noted: "Blink example invert unnecessary, emulator sw/led one is wrong"

- [x] Emulator I/O verified correct: S2 pull-up (default high), D2 active-low
- [x] Button Echo XOR inversion is correct (reads high=released, XOR→LED on when pressed)
- [ ] Review if "invert unnecessary" means the XOR in Button Echo should be removed
  because the hardware LED is also active-low (writing 1 = pull low = LED on)

### Sidebar buttons too narrow (meeting notes)

Luther noted: "buttons on left are not wide enough"

- [ ] Review sidebar button width in CSS

### Rate limiter for emulator (meeting notes)

- [x] Per-instruction run loop with speed slider — implemented
- [x] Log-scale slider: 10/s to 1000/s — implemented

## I/O Hardware Details (research/feedback3.txt)

- [x] D1 = power LED, D2 = user LED — D2 in emulator
- [x] S2 = momentary button (normal high, pressed low) — in emulator
- [x] No halt instruction, use bra to self — all examples use this pattern
- [x] Never use r3-r5 as GP registers — enforced in examples
- [x] Memory layout: code at 0, I/O at 0xFF0000+ — in ISA Ref memory map
- [ ] More examples needed for various features — ongoing
- [ ] NOP = jmp -2 (alternative) — not implemented, using 0xFF
- [ ] HALT = jmp -4 — not implemented, using bra-to-self
